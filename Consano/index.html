      <p>
        Bullying between girls in high school often goes unnoticed because it’s covert and manipulative. It’s not just “mean girl drama”—it’s emotional abuse that can deeply affect mental health. Signs include gossip, exclusion, passive-aggressive behavior, and toxic friendships.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to BeeWell data, girls report lower wellbeing than boys, partly due to these hidden forms of bullying. Our mission is to raise awareness and provide tools for healing and resilience.
