	<p> Spending everyday being subject to passive aggressive comments, dirty looks and snide remarks is likely putting you in a state of hypervigilance.

<br> <br> The stress you are feeling is likely putting your body in a defensive mode like fight or flight. 

<br><br> This will likely mean you’re holding a lot of tension in your body, and that the trauma is being stored there too. It makes it difficult for you to focus and feel relaxed.

<br> <br> These situations can be traumatising and have negative impacts on your mental health

<p>You don’t have to deal with this on your own or continue suffering. 
Sometimes the best course of action can be for an adult to confront the individuals if their behaviour 
is increasingly serious and moving into harrassment.  </p>

<p> <strong> Deep Breathing Exercises </strong>,  these are to not stop you from feeling, but rather giving your body the space to actually fully feel the emotions and pain you have and let it out.

<br> <br> 
<strong> Somatic Yoga </strong>This is a mindfulness practice that involves slow yoga poses that invite you to increase you awareness of your bodily sensations and release tension stored in the body. It’s a lot gentler than ordinary yoga (which is still also a helpful tool).

<p> <strong> Exercise </strong> Will increase the blood flow to your brain and therefore improve your mood, sleep and cognitive function. Exercising regularly , perhaps even trying out a new sport, will give you sustained benefits. </p> 
<p> <strong> Vagus Nerve Exercises </strong>  The vagus nerve is the longest nerve in the body and has impact on a lot of different things. When you are constantly under stress, the vagus nerve can be overstimulated, making you feel less relaxed. There are simple, safe exercises you can do to bring your body out of this state and into a calmer one.<br>

<p>
<strong> Journalling </strong> 
This is a great tool for self reflection and building a more positive relationship with yourself. Try out the activities around the website but also the journalling prompts sheet in the resources section. You can also write positive affirmations about yourself to build a habit of valid
ating yourself and being the friend to yourself that you deserve. 
<br> <br> 
<strong> Nature Walks </strong> 
Research from the University of Exeter has shown that exposure and walks in nature improves your brain activity, mental health and can lift your mood. 

<strong> Music </strong> 

Whether this be your favourite artist or some calming jazz, music will certainly elevate your mood and remind you of the more positive parts of your life. 

</p> 
</div> 
<p>

 
<strong> Meditation </strong> 
his can be particularly useful when you’re in the midst of these negative situations. Bringing yourself back to the present moment can help you to ground yourself and remind yourself that these people don’t have real power to control you.
<br><br>  Observing the memories that could come to the surface when you do meditate can help you to understand what is affecting you most as well. It is also a sign that your body and mind are trying to heal which is always good but can be difficult. 
<br> <br> You could start with the mindly 5 minute meditations. These are short and simple to follow along to but will still be beneficial. Following on from that  you could try out apps like Headspace and Calm or the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m00175qd">BBC Music and Meditation Podcast</a>

 <p> <strong> Build your confidence by learning new skills. </strong> 
 these not only serve as a good distraction, but make you more intelligent and improve your self-esteem. Knitting, embroidery, guitar, piano, drawing, pinterest board making ( I argue this could be a skill of its own) are just some ideas of things you could start doing.  </p>
