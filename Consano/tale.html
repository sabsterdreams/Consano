  <div class="flex-item">The first pages of a book set the tone for the story you are going to read. Like how the words ‘ Once upon a time’ tell you that you’re reading a fairytale. The front cover may also reflect this, with fairytale ones usually being very pretty and decorated with flowers and ballgowns.</div>

   <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
  <p style="margin-left: 30px"> This is what everyone sees at first. Some may never pick up the book, but you did. You thought you knew what to expect as many other fairytale stories look and sound similar. <br> Maybe you noticed that the book itself felt a bit different, but it would be hard for you to tell. That’s why you shouldn’t blame yourself for starting to read the story…</p>

  <p> <br><br><br> Ordinary people can match up to the early signs, its difficult to distinguish them from those who aren’t behaving from a truly kind place<br><br><br> </p>

  <p > <br><br> The book seemed really good at first, almost too much of a fairytale. 

But as you kept reading, the tone started to change. 

Things started to sound a lot darker...<br><br> </p>


<p> Sometimes the book would go back to sounding like a fairytale again. <br> <br>

But then it would return to sounding like a horror story. <br> <br>

Part of you still wanted to keep reading as maybe the fairytale was always the main story. 
The sudden changes kept you hooked.   </p>

  <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">



<p>
Emotional abuse works in a similar way.  You keep feeling good and then bad around the person. 

Other times you may find the person very annoying, without being able to explain why. 

Sometimes this can be down to your own insecurities, but often it can be because you are sensing 
something isn’t genuine. 

Remember you never have to read the full story. If you feel uncomfortable take the steps to leave safely.

<p>The feeling you had was right. It wasn’t a fairytale after all. In fact it is a horror book. The plot doesn’t make sense anymore, it’s the total opposite from the beginning. That was a disguise all along.

Others may not believe you when you tell them the truth about the book. Not because you’re wrong, but because from their perspective they only know about the front cover and first pages. The ones that made it seem like a fairytale. </p>
