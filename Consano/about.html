  <title>	About </title>
  I'm Sabina, a university student. 
  I was motivated to create this website from my own personal experiences with emotional abuse and bullying. Having attended an all girls school,
  I know first hand the struggles many young girls face when it comes to their friendships. 
  More specifically when these friendship issues start to lean into something much more serious than simple fall outs.
 <br><br> I wanted to created the resource I wish I had when I was younger. A place for teens. 
  A place where the difficult emotions that arise from these issues could be validated. 
  A place where one can receive advice on how to grow from these experiences.

  
 <br><br>
 I created Aware (in the resources section) to serve as a medium to educate young people on different forms of emotional abuse. 
 I also wanted to show how more minor behaviours can escalate through the use of relatable scenarios. The reflective prompts and quizzes aim to 
 engage pupils and get them to think more critically about what plays a role in unhealthy dynamics. 
  
  <br><br>
    My hope is that this website helps young girls feel supported and more educated, so that they can build stronger, healthier connections.
