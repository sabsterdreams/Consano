Most people are stalked by people that already know them. Stalking often occurs when someone ends a relationship. This is why it is vital to observe people's behaviour early on to see if there are signs of emotionally abusive tendencies.

  <div class="info">
 Stalking is a serious issue. Blocking and reporting are great first steps. It is important to <strong> document everything </strong> (eg.screenshots of messages, photos) so that you have enough evidence if it escalates to the point where the police need to get involved. 
 If you are feeling scared, <strong> talk to trusted adults </strong> and friends about what is going on so that they can keep an eye on you and ensure that you are safe. You may need to start <strong> changing your routines </strong>  or seat in class to minimise the amount of contact you have with the stalker.
